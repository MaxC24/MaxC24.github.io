					<p>I am a Web Developer proficient in a wide range of development and design technologies: Javascript, Angular, Node, Express, Mongoose, React, Html, Css, Java, C++, Photoshop, Final cut, Premiere, Illustrator...</p>
					<p>I devote most of my time building applications and learning new technologies, but prior to becoming a Software Engineer I spent years in the filmmaking industry. Many of the films I shot or directed were accepted into world renowned film festivals, and a few even won awards. The last one titled "The First Anniversary" was accepted and screened at Cannes Film Festival in 2016. I also dedicated a lot of my time to writing: one of the screenplays I wrote was shortlisted and published.</p>
